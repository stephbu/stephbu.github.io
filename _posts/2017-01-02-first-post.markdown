First post after quite a long hiatus, figured I'd go back to some lightweight writing after
spending a decent week off over Christmas holidays playing games, and writing code in Swift and Go.

I'm using Jekyll hosted on [GitHub], mapped thru to a custom domain (rinserepeatprofit.com)
I might be tempted to host some other services on the domain at a later date.
