Steve has spent the majority of his life working in the tech-industry.
After 20 years at Microsoft working on his own personal [Fortress of Solitude](https://kurtsh.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/imag0456-copy5b25d.jpg), he realized that life is too
short, and went to work on games at Electronic Arts instead.

Beyond family and work commitments he is interested in gaming, software development, and photography.
